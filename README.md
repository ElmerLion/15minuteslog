# Log What You Are Working On Every 15 Minutes
A time tracker that asks you to log what you are working on every 15 minutes.

**Keep in mind you have to have Python 3.9+ installed for this to work.**
To start the program, go into you CMD and use "cd" to the folder where the program is stored. So if you have it in the downloads folder just run "cd downloads".

Then run "python 15MinutesLog.py" to start the program in that cmd.

Now a dialog will popup every 15 minutes where you input what you are currently working on. All your entries will be stored in the same folder in a file called time_log.csv.
